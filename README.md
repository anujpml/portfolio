## ✨ Product Philosophy

> “Real product leadership is aligning chaos into clarity—by listening well, thinking deep, and shipping deliberately.”

I love tackling ambiguous platform challenges, scaling internal tooling, and launching AI-first products with a bias toward experimentation and learning. Whether it’s shaping an agentic AI infrastructure or empowering a clinical user with insights at the point of care—my goal is to build for real outcomes.
