# 🧠 Anuj — Product Strategy. Platform Thinking. AI-Driven Impact.

Welcome to my product portfolio. I’m a **Product Leader with 12+ years** of experience building and scaling enterprise-grade platforms—especially in **AI/ML**, **healthcare**, and **data infrastructure**.

If you're into building real products for real people—where business value, engineering complexity, and user empathy intersect—you're in the right place.

## ✨ Product Philosophy

> “Real product leadership is aligning chaos into clarity—by listening well, thinking deep, and shipping deliberately.”

I love tackling ambiguous platform challenges, scaling internal tooling, and launching AI-first products with a bias toward experimentation and learning. Whether it’s shaping an agentic AI infrastructure or empowering a clinical user with insights at the point of care—my goal is to build for real outcomes.
