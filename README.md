## 👋 Welcome to My Product Portfolio
Here you’ll find case studies and work samples from 8 enterprise-grade productivity and automation platforms that I’ve built, monetized, and scaled across industries like healthcare, cybersecurity, and AI infrastructure.

## [Portfolio](https://github.com/anujpml/portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio.md) Summary

| Market Segment | Products | Stages | Key Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI & Data Infrastructure** | Minerva, Intelligent Automation Platform, ARST | 0-10 | AI/LLM processing, developer productivity |
| **Cybersecurity** | RapidDFIR | 0-1 | Threat intelligence and incident response |
| **Healthcare** | Clinical Assistant Platform, ePAMS, Connected Healthcare | 0-10 | Clinical Decisioning, IoT monitoring, Telehealth |

This repository also features a curated collection of my work in product strategy, platform thinking, and entrepreneurial initiatives. Each section highlights real-world challenges, my approach to solving them, and the measurable outcomes delivered.

Whether you're exploring how I’ve shaped scalable platforms or how I lead through product discovery, roadmap execution, and go-to-market strategy — I hope this gives you a clear sense of how I think, build, and drive impact.

If you're into building real products for real people—where business value, engineering complexity, and user empathy intersect—you're in the right place.

## ✨ Product Philosophy

> “Real product leadership is aligning chaos into clarity—by listening well, thinking deep, and shipping deliberately.”

I love tackling ambiguous platform challenges, scaling internal tooling, and launching AI-first products with a bias toward experimentation and learning. Whether it’s shaping an agentic AI infrastructure or empowering a clinical user with insights at the point of care—my goal is to build for real outcomes.
